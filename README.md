# Tata Steel Predictive Analysis

This repository contains predictive analysis models and data processing scripts for Tata Steel. The analysis aims at improving production efficiency and predicting potential issues in the manufacturing process.

## Project Overview

This project is developed using Jupyter Notebook and includes various data analysis and machine learning models to predict and analyze different aspects of Tata Steel's production process. The main objectives of this project are:
- To analyze historical data from Tata Steel's production process.
- To develop predictive models that can forecast potential issues and inefficiencies.
- To provide insights and recommendations for improving production efficiency.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Chandra731/Tata-steel-Predictive-analysis.git
cd Tata-steel-Predictive-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the `Analysis_and_Model_training.ipynb` and open the Jupyter notebooks to explore the analysis and models.
2. Use the scripts in the `scripts` directory to preprocess data and train models.
3. Save and load trained models from the `best_lgbm_model.pkl` file.
